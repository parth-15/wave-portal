It is an app that allows you to write a message to me.

This message is stored on the Ethereum testnet blockchain, and in my generosity, I randomly send some eths to someone that sends a message. Yeah, fake eth ðŸ™‚. 

I had fun doing this while learning a lot, both on the front end and the smart contract. I was able to listen to events on the blockchain. I was able to add items to the blockchain and read from the blockchain.

I was also able perfectly to handle different exceptions, errors, and warnings in such a way as to give users a very smooth experience.
